        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This website will act as a resume of sorts for my ability to design and create websites. My intended audience for this is primarily prospective employers, however, clients may also be a target audience. I expect that when they come to this website, they will be wondering why they should choose to hire me or choose me as the one they want to design and create their website. My website will contain the appropriate information to answer this question.
      </p>
      <p>
	      When they come to my site, I want my target audiences to be compelled enough to view and read each page. To me, this means keeping things concise and using attention-getting words and visuals. I donâ€™t want anyone to lose focus or feel like they have to force themselves to continue reading. However, with this in mind, I want to be sure that it does not look too basic or cheesy. I still need to upkeep a highly professional look and feel to this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the information that my website will contain, each page will have a different topic that pertains to my experience. The main page will show an overview of my coding capabilities as well as an overview of my other work and volunteer experience. The main page will be the most important page as it will draw in the reader to want to view my other pages. It will contain an image of me as well as various images that pertain to my experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also need to find professional pictures of myself and pictures that sufficiently display the ideas and feel that I want anyone looking at my website to have.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good thing about making a site that acts as a resume or portfolio is that this is the only place that they can go to get this information. However, I also realize that this may not be a benefit at all. I realize that I cannot be relaxed about this site. This lack of competition, in this instance, means that I need to work even harder as this will be the site that I send to potential employers to showcase my credentials. By the very design of this site I still must keep a high degree of professionalism and cleanliness in how I put it together. I suppose I need to answer the question of why, then, will they take the time to read my site and to go to the two next pages on my site. I need to give them good reasoning to do this in my very first page. I will need to ensure that my main page looks good and is one that is indicative of how well I am able to put together a website.

      </ul>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        My second page will be all about my education, particularly relating to my coding ability and experience. I will include not only my experience with html and css, but all other coding experience as well. I may even link in some other websites that I have made as well as examples of code that I have put together. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to fully complete this page of my website, I will include my education experience. I will also need to look back on all the coding projects I have done and determine which ones are good enough and clean enough to include as a piece of my resume.

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        My third page will be a page about my work, education, and volunteer experience to include a condensed version of my resume. This page will not be very detailed. It will be a general overview of what my experience contains, but since this site is not primarily about this, this will be little more than a listing of my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this page of my website, I will need to assemble my work, volunteer, and education experience as well.

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>         
        Under the Engineering, Leadership, and Work Experience headers I will write a few sentences that highlight my experience in that particular section. In the resume section I will include an at-a-glance version of my resume.
