            <h4>Engineering</h4>
            <p>Not only do I have many engineering courses under my belt, but I also have years of experience with highly technical problem-solving and engineering. The most recent of which is with ASML, the most advanced and in demand semiconductor lithography company in the world. Through my engineering experience I have learned strong troubleshooting skills.</p>
