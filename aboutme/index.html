    <h2>Gabe Wahlberg</h2>
    <p>My name is Gabriel Wahlber, but I go by Gabe. I am currently working towards a bachelor's degree in 
        Software Development. I have been married for six years and we have two young sons who keep daily life 
        exciting! 
    <p>I am currently an engineer in the semiconductor industry, and I love my job. I am hoping that 
        through my education and degree it will help expand my career possibilities within my field.

     <p>I love BYU-Idaho because of the opportunity that it provides for those who aren't necessarily able to go to 
        school in person. I also appreciate the daily spiritual upliftment that comes through attending. I am 
        lucky enough to be a lifelong member of the Church and was able to serve my mission in the Hawaii Honolulu
         Mission. I returned home in 2013.
